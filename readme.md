google vr sdk is the one downlaoded from udacity link. I think the version is 1.0.3

Name: Manikandan Mohan
It took about a couple hours to finish the project

one thing I liked was the customization of lights and how cool it can make things look.

One thing that was challenging was setting up animations and trigger.
